## Deep-Learning-Time-Series-Forecasting
This topic comes from industrial research collaboration initiative between Becton Dickinson (BD) and NTU to develop AI solutions for demand forecasting and inventory optimization. Professor Jagath and his team is currently working on the topic, and we would like to explore the new deep learning methodology, leading to a research paper and high academic performance thorughout CE7454.
