## Deep-Learning-Time-Series-Forecasting
This topic comes from industrial research collaboration initiative between Becton Dickinson (BD) and NTU to develop AI solutions for demand forecasting and inventory optimization. Professor Jagath and his team is currently working on the topic, and we would like to explore the new deep learning methodology, leading to a research paper and high academic performance thorughout CE7454.

## Paper
Data used for this research project is protected by Resaerch Collaboration Agreement between BD-NTU, therefore BD resevers right to approve any publications. Therefore it is advised to also explore other datasets used to implement our proposing methodologies.

Although there is no limitation to the number of co-authors on the paper we plan, it can be important to have a consensus prior to our works to ensure all of us have contributed in significant ways and can actually qualify to be a co-author.
